{% for title in site.defaults %}
	<h3>{{ title.about }}</h3>
	This is some info about papillon mer.
	This is otherwise known as the output for { { content } }, which is only in the right side of the layout. Right now, you need to figure out how to generate content on the left side, specific to the project...
	<h3>{{ title.role }}</h3>
	And then also add the 'related projects' at the bottom of EVERY post!
