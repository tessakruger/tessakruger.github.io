I earned my B.Sc in Life Sciences with a minor in History from this [university][mac] in Hamilton

After many years wearing many hats at an event admissions solutions company, I discovered my passion for problem solving resided in writing code. I attended a bootcamp where I am now also a mentor shaping the young minds of tomorrow.

I love maps. I love looking at Google Maps. I love working with Google Maps APIs. I travel a lot and have an uncanny sense of direction.

I have an impossibly adorable dog named Heidi.

Sometimes I like to tinker around on [codepen][codepen].
